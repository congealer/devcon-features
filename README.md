# Dev Container Features: Self Authoring Template

> This repo provides a starting point and example for creating your own custom [dev container Features](https://containers.dev/implementors/features/), hosted for free on GitHub Container Registry.  The example in this repository follows the [dev container Feature distribution specification](https://containers.dev/implementors/features-distribution/).  
>
> To provide feedback to the specification, please leave a comment [on spec issue #70](https://github.com/devcontainers/spec/issues/70). For more broad feedback regarding dev container Features, please see [spec issue #61](https://github.com/devcontainers/spec/issues/61).

## Example Contents

This repository contains a _collection_ of two Features - `hello` and `color`. These Features serve as simple feature implementations.  Each sub-section below shows a sample `devcontainer.json` alongside example usage of the Feature.

### `hello`

Running `hello` inside the built container will print the greeting provided to it via its `greeting` option.

```jsonc
{
    "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/base:ubuntu",
    "features": {
        "ghcr.io/devcontainers/feature-starter/hello:1": {
            "greeting": "Hello"
        }
    }
}
```

```bash
$ hello

Hello, user.
```

### `color`

Running `color` inside the built container will print your favorite color to standard out.

```jsonc
{
    "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/base:ubuntu",
    "features": {
        "ghcr.io/devcontainers/feature-starter/color:1": {
            "favorite": "green"
        }
    }
}
```

```bash
$ color

my favorite color is green
```

## Repo and Feature Structure

Similar to the [`devcontainers/features`](https://github.com/devcontainers/features) repo, this repository has a `src` folder.  Each Feature has its own sub-folder, containing at least a `devcontainer-feature.json` and an entrypoint script `install.sh`. 

```
├── src
│   ├── hello
│   │   ├── devcontainer-feature.json
│   │   └── install.sh
│   ├── color
│   │   ├── devcontainer-feature.json
│   │   └── install.sh
|   ├── ...
│   │   ├── devcontainer-feature.json
│   │   └── install.sh
...
```

An [implementing tool](https://containers.dev/supporting#tools) will composite [the documented dev container properties](https://containers.dev/implementors/features/#devcontainer-feature-json-properties) from the feature's `devcontainer-feature.json` file, and execute in the `install.sh` entrypoint script in the container during build time.  Implementing tools are also free to process attributes under the `customizations` property as desired.

### Options

All available options for a Feature should be declared in the `devcontainer-feature.json`.  The syntax for the `options` property can be found in the [devcontainer Feature json properties reference](https://containers.dev/implementors/features/#devcontainer-feature-json-properties).

For example, the `color` feature provides an enum of three possible options (`red`, `gold`, `green`).  If no option is provided in a user's `devcontainer.json`, the value is set to "red".

```jsonc
{
    // ...
    "options": {
        "favorite": {
            "type": "string",
            "enum": [
                "red",
                "gold",
                "green"
            ],
            "default": "red",
            "description": "Choose your favorite color."
        }
    }
}
```

Options are exported as Feature-scoped environment variables.  The option name is captialized and sanitized according to [option resolution](https://containers.dev/implementors/features/#option-resolution).

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Activating feature 'color'"
echo "The provided favorite color is: ${FAVORITE}"

...
```

## Distributing Features

### Versioning

Features are individually versioned by the `version` attribute in a Feature's `devcontainer-feature.json`.  Features are versioned according to the semver specification. More details can be found in [the dev container Feature specification](https://containers.dev/implementors/features/#versioning).

### Publishing

> NOTE: The Distribution spec can be [found here](https://containers.dev/implementors/features-distribution/).  
>
> While any registry [implementing the OCI Distribution spec](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec) can be used, this template will leverage GHCR (GitHub Container Registry) as the backing registry.

Features are meant to be easily sharable units of dev container configuration and installation code.  

This repo contains a **GitHub Action** [workflow](.github/workflows/release.yaml) that will publish each Feature to GHCR. 

*Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests* should be enabled in the repository's `Settings > Actions > General > Workflow permissions` for auto generation of `src/<feature>/README.md` per Feature (which merges any existing `src/<feature>/NOTES.md`).

By default, each Feature will be prefixed with the `<owner/<repo>` namespace.  For example, the two Features in this repository can be referenced in a `devcontainer.json` with:

```
ghcr.io/devcontainers/feature-starter/color:1
ghcr.io/devcontainers/feature-starter/hello:1
```

The provided GitHub Action will also publish a third "metadata" package with just the namespace, eg: `ghcr.io/devcontainers/feature-starter`.  This contains information useful for tools aiding in Feature discovery.

'`devcontainers/feature-starter`' is known as the feature collection namespace.

### Marking Feature Public

Note that by default, GHCR packages are marked as `private`.  To stay within the free tier, Features need to be marked as `public`.

This can be done by navigating to the Feature's "package settings" page in GHCR, and setting the visibility to 'public`.  The URL may look something like:

```
https://github.com/users/<owner>/packages/container/<repo>%2F<featureName>/settings
```

### Adding Features to the Index

If you'd like your Features to appear in our [public index](https://containers.dev/features) so that other community members can find them, you can do the following:

* Go to [github.com/devcontainers/devcontainers.github.io](https://github.com/devcontainers/devcontainers.github.io)
     * This is the GitHub repo backing the [containers.dev](https://containers.dev/) spec site
* Open a PR to modify the [collection-index.yml](https://github.com/devcontainers/devcontainers.github.io/blob/gh-pages/_data/collection-index.yml) file

This index is from where [supporting tools](https://containers.dev/supporting) like [VS Code Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) and [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) surface Features for their dev container creation UI.

#### Using private Features in Codespaces

For any Features hosted in GHCR that are kept private, the `GITHUB_TOKEN` access token in your environment will need to have `package:read` and `contents:read` for the associated repository.

Many implementing tools use a broadly scoped access token and will work automatically.  GitHub Codespaces uses repo-scoped tokens, and therefore you'll need to add the permissions in `devcontainer.json`

An example `devcontainer.json` can be found below.

```jsonc
{
    "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/base:ubuntu",
    "features": {
     "ghcr.io/my-org/private-features/hello:1": {
            "greeting": "Hello"
        }
    },
    "customizations": {
        "codespaces": {
            "repositories": {
                "my-org/private-features": {
                    "permissions": {
                        "packages": "read",
                        "contents": "read"
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Testing Features

### Running Tests

테스트는 두 가지 방식으로 실행할 수 있습니다:

1. **기본 테스트만 실행 (`--skip-scenarios` 사용)**
```bash
devcontainer features test \
    --features color \
    --remote-user root \
    --skip-scenarios \
    --base-image mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/base:ubuntu \
    .
```
- `test.sh` 파일의 기본 테스트만 실행
- 빠르고 간단한 테스트가 필요할 때 사용
- 시나리오 설정이나 의존성을 신경쓰지 않아도 됨

2. **모든 시나리오 테스트 실행 (`--skip-scenarios` 미사용)**
```bash
devcontainer features test \
    --features color \
    --remote-user root \
    --base-image mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/base:ubuntu \
    .
```
- `test.sh` 기본 테스트와 함께 `scenarios.json`에 정의된 모든 시나리오를 실행
- 시나리오 예시:
  - `my_favorite_color_is_green`: common-utils 설치, octocat 사용자 설정
  - `gold`: gold 색상 테스트
  - `green`: green 색상 테스트
- 더 포괄적인 테스트가 필요할 때 사용
- 시나리오에 정의된 모든 의존성이 올바르게 설정되어야 함

테스트 파일들은 `test` 디렉토리에 있으며, 각 기능별로 자체 테스트 디렉토리를 가집니다. 예를 들어, `color` 기능의 테스트는 `test/color/test.sh`에 있습니다.

테스트는 devcontainer CLI와 함께 제공되는 테스트 라이브러리를 사용하며, `check`와 `reportResults` 같은 유용한 명령어를 제공합니다. 자세한 내용은 [공식 문서](https://github.com/devcontainers/cli/blob/main/docs/features/test.md)를 참조하세요.
